# Beer collection app

- This is a React based app
- Started from my custom plain boilerplate react app
- App does not have any persistance layer
- First beers are loaded from static JSON file
- State is managed by Redux
- Basic CRUD actions are working nicely
- User can also add Beer from Beer Directory, which fetches beers from the Punk API
- There is little buggy pagination to fetch next/previous pages
